NAME
====

ChatBot::Simple - a new and flexible chatbot engine in Perl.

DESCRIPTION
===========

ChatBot::Simple is a flexible chatbot engine written in Perl.

Instead of specifying the chatbot knowledge base in xml, we are
going to use the powerful text manipulation capabilities of Perl.

The rationale behind this decision is that "simple" AI languages,
like AIML, are only simple if you want to do simple things. Once
you start adding features, they quickly become unmanageable.

ChatBot::Simple's design goal is to make easy things easy, and
difficult things possible.

FEATURES
========

Simple pattern/responses
------------------------

	pattern 'hello' => 'hi!';

Multiple patterns
-----------------

    pattern [ 'hi', 'hello' ] => 'hi!';

Multiple (random) responses
---------------------------

	pattern 'hello' => [ 'hi!', 'hello!', 'wazzzzup!' ];

Named parameters
----------------

	pattern "my name is :name" => "hello, :name!";

Code execution
--------------

	pattern "my name is :name" => sub {
		my ($str,$param) = @_;

        if ( $param->{':name'} eq 'nobody' ) {
            return 'No, really... what is your name?';
        }

		return;
	} => "nice to meet you, :name!";

Multiple named parameters
-------------------------

	my %var;

	pattern "define :variable as :value" => sub {
		my ($str,$param) = @_;

		my $variable = $param->{':variable'};
		my $value    = $param->{':value'};

		$var{$variable} = $value;

		return;
	} => 'ok';

Regular expressions
-------------------

	pattern qr{what is (\d+) ([+-/*]) (\d+)} => sub {
		my ($str,$param) = @_;

		my ($n1,$op,$n2) = ($param->{1}, $param->{2}, $param->{3});
		# ...

		return $result;
	};

Transformations
---------------

Transformations can be used to normalize input, and are performed
before the pattern matching:

	transform "I'm"    => "I am"
	transform "you're" => "you are";
	transform "what's" => "what is";

They can use parameters as well:

	transform "I am called :name" => "my name is :name";

(See more examples in the "t/" directory.)
